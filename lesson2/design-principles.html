            <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
            <h4>RCWilley</h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/RCWilley.png" alt="RCWilley Home Page">
                <figcaption><a href="https://www.rcwilley.com" target="_blank">www.rcwiller.com</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Alignment allows to see the page more easily and clearly. This give us a sense that nothing is there as if it were placed there randomly. RCWilley is a really good example for this because everything on their page is ordered, everything is line up very carefully. thanks to this is easier to look up for what we are looking for.</p>

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <h4>Puma</h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/puma.png" alt="Puma Home Page">
                <figcaption><a href="https://us.puma.com/" target="_blank">www.puma.com</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Visual hierarchy is the presentation of design elements in order of their importance. It influences the order in which the human eye perceives the information that is being displayed. Puma is a Good example because we can see that the image uses almost all the page. They are giving more importance to the product. Then, you see the text relative to the image and after that the button to shop the shoe</p>

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <h4>Guitar Center</h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/guitarcenter.png" alt="Guitar Options">
                <figcaption><a href="https://www.guitarcenter.com" target="_blank">www.guitarcenter.com</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This law is named after a team of British and American psychologists team of William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. He says users bombarded with options must take time to interpret and decide, giving them work they don't want. In other words, the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of the options. So, I think Guitar Center helps a lot with its “categories” because it’s providing a better way for users to make a decision about what they want.</p>
